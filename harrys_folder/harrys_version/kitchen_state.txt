As you exit through the narrow door, you find yourself in a long, dimly lit corridor that stretches off into the distance. The walls are adorned with cobweb-covered portraits and the air is musty with age. A faint scent of old books and dust wafts through the air. To your left lies a narrow staircase leading up to unknown floors, while to your right lies another corridor, seemingly leading deeper into the east wing.
