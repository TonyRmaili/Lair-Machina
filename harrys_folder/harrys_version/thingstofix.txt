###done###
fix so ollama runs on the server - DONE -> WORKS (now running llama3.1 - not sure if best option, but using that for now)


####works better on llama3.1- and with added examples###
# doesnt reply with just the JSON - starts or ends with "ofc I can do that blabla " or "I may have missed something please let me know if.."
# doesnt do a great job - makes wierd categories / makes stuff up / misses things


WORKS-
make the TTS thing work on server - works as in it is isntalled and can generate speech, but playing sound in pygame, now also possible from the server with noMachine


>> fix move thing - make it so move is separate action/option -> gives options for all adjacent rooms (work on locks, multi floors etc later)


###to do### 

>> use the context thing to generate the castle/cave >
>> fix loop so more minor updates (maybe action option - interact/take > ask/look > ) > work on rolls/test later 
>> make inventory - > also maybe use keyword to call action ? (testa iaf) 





####solve it####
# use other method of generating world, not text > JSON  but more exact pipeline with limited loops - LAND/LOCATION - QUEST - NPC - ITEMS etc - and do JSON in that loop - maybe as part of each item/object
# limit scope of generation - maybe into single dungeon crawl or more railroady adventure?

# test with small scope - like single room - and see if works
# it will hallucinate wierd things like player options and dice rolls- maybe solve with more prompting? (or worst case fine tune)
# It seems to be able to change the JSON sort of? - maybe have separate request that changes the JSON
#not super obvious how it will work - maybe limit actions to use Action function, and object tags? - so that the LLM then can change the exact object in the exact way

#will be massive amount of data very fast -> keep it super simple?


EXPLORE cave/castle/city/other - dungeon crawl mode

#talk
#look/ask
#action/interact
#move - works (but not with locks, slow to get out of a place, and no multi floor/exit function, also later- add so dont have name for each room shown asap)

inventory
### it turns out the LLM is very stupid - > 2 options -  try to go even harder on promptengineering and format/context stuff - OR - go more hardcoded - like keywords alla CAPS
>>> problem right now - it sucks att making JSON 


Combat mode - 

travel/worldmap/hexcrawl mode -


character generation >
dungeon generation >
World generation > 


### soundeffect for dice roll?
### soundeffect for attack action?
### display battle grid + hp?
### attack default or attack + add flavor text (?) 


### test whisper? too slow?

### test generate img option?

### fix inventory?

### so far: 
### basic attack actions loop for combat + play music and voiceover narration



### make world mode?
### telling the computer what you want and it generates it? 
### generate monsters

### time frame > new action = new time /state > update relevant JSONS + state
### if in a city and go to sleep - change some things?

###hex mode for LAND, > city > dungeon > etc
###travel + encounters? 

for quest land wise > get to city X to warn the king or find the magic Y in dungeon Z
