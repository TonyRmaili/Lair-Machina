    "description": "The underwater research facility was once a state-of-the-art laboratory for studying the unique marine life and ecosystems of the deep ocean. However, after years of neglect and abandonment, it has become a treacherous maze of twisted corridors and dark chambers. The walls are covered in coral, anemones, and glowing jellyfish, casting eerie shadows on the floor. Water leaks from the cracked pipes, creating small pools that reflect the faint light filtering through the grimy windows. The air is thick with the stench of decay and rotting fish.",
