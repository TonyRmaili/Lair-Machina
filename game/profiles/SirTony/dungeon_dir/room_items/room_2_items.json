        "name": "Lunar Lyre",
        "description": "A delicate, crystal-stringed instrument that seems to have been crafted from the very essence of the moon. Its surface is adorned with intricate engravings that shimmer and shine in the soft light, and its soundbox appears to be filled with a fine, powdery dust that glows with a soft, lunar energy."
