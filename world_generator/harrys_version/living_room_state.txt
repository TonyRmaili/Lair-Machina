Location: Living room of the castle green spire
Description/state: A messy living room with soft lighting, a fireplace in the corner still burning, and a large window overlooking the garden. The furniture is now knocked askew, and pieces are strewn about the floor. The table that was neatly arranged near the window lies on its side, as if someone had carelessly flipped it over.
