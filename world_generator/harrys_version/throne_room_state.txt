Here is the updated room description:

Throne Room:
The throne room is a grand chamber with high ceilings and walls lined with intricate tapestries. A large, ornate throne sits atop a raised dais at the far end of the room, but it now appears to be empty, as you've taken the regal-looking crown from its resting place. The air is thick with the scent of old wood polish and the faint hint of incense. Two heavy, dark-wooden doors with brass hardware lead out of the chamber, one to your north and the other to your east. A large, rectangular window on the southern wall lets in slivers of sunlight, casting a warm glow across the room.

As you look around, you notice that there are indeed several items in the room, but they seem less significant now that you've taken the crown. On a nearby table against the eastern wall, there is an ornate candelabra with three lit candles, which casts flickering shadows on the walls. The candles appear to be still burning, but they're no longer illuminated by the crown's presence. On a pedestal near where the throne once stood, you see a small, intricately carved wooden box with a delicate lock and a golden keyhole. Additionally, you see a few scattered parchments on a nearby stool, which appear to be official documents of some sort.

You hold the crown in your hand, feeling its weight and admiring its craftsmanship. It's possible that taking this item will have significant consequences, or perhaps it's simply an interesting trinket. You'll need to decide what to do next.
