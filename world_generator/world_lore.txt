Welcome to the world of Elyria, a vast and wondrous realm of ancient magic, sprawling landscapes, and intricate politics.

**Geography and Climate**

Elyria is comprised of four major continents: Aethoria, the land of eternal dawn; Terraverde, a verdant expanse of forests and grasslands; Eldrador, a frozen tundra home to mighty ice giants; and Valtoria, a scorching desert realm of shifting sands. Each continent is divided into distinct regions, each with its unique climate, geography, and ecosystem.

The landmasses are surrounded by the Endless Ocean, a seemingly infinite body of water that teems with marine life, hidden treasures, and untold dangers. The ocean's boundaries are marked by the Spine of Elyria, a vast chain of volcanic islands that rise from the depths like giants' teeth.
