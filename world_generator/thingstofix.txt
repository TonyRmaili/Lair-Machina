# doesnt reply with just the JSON - starts or ends with "ofc I can do that blabla " or "I may have missed something please let me know if.."
# doesnt do a great job - makes wierd categories / makes stuff up / misses things

####solve it####
# use other method of generating world, not text > JSON  but more exact pipeline with limited loops - LAND/LOCATION - QUEST - NPC - ITEMS etc - and do JSON in that loop - maybe as part of each item/object
# limit scope of generation - maybe into single dungeon crawl or more railroady adventure?

# test with small scope - like single room - and see if works
# it will hallucinate wierd things like player options and dice rolls- maybe solve with more prompting? (or worst case fine tune)
# It seems to be able to change the JSON sort of? - maybe have separate request that changes the JSON
#not super obvious how it will work - maybe limit actions to use Action function, and object tags? - so that the LLM then can change the exact object in the exact way

#will be massive amount of data very fast -> keep it super simple?

#talk
#action
#move
#### > feed JSON + last message?
